# jekyll-related-posts

Proper related posts plugin for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) - uses document correlation matrix on TF-IDF (optionally with Latent Semantic Indexing).

## Example

Example is provided at http://jekyll-related-posts.dev.amadeusz.me - posts are
based on [Reuters-21578](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Reuters-21578+Text+Categorization+Collection) data set.

## Introduction

I am going to try to start blogging, again. Anyway I am studying at
Decision Support Systems Group and I have found document correlation
problem somehow interesting.

For my own purposes I have created related posts Jekyll plugin based on well
known algorithms such as [TFIDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tfâ€“idf)
and [LSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_indexing).

## How to install

Initialy you had to install the plugin manually, however the plugin is a
gem now - follow instructions to install the plugin:

1. Install the gem `jekyll-related-posts`
  - if you are using bundler add `gem 'jekyll-related-posts'` to your
    `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`
  - or install gem via `gem install jekyll-related-posts`
2. Insert `<related-posts />` somewhere in your `_layouts/post.html`
file.
3. Run `jekyll build`, don't forget to blog about the plugin!

### Customization

You can customize default related posts template by creating
`related.html` in your layouts directory. Plugin behaviour can be
altered by options in `_config.yml`, under `related:` section.

## Basis of operation

Each document is
[tokenized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_(lexical_analysis))
and [stemmed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming), every word found
is treated as keyword for analysis (except for some [stop
words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words)). 

TF-IDF matrix for the whole site is calculated (including extra provided 
weights), then if given accuraccy is lower than 1.0, LSI algorithm 
is used to compute new simplified vector space. Document correlation 
matrix is created using dot product of the matrix and its transpose.

For each of the post' related documents are inserted into priority queue
(sorted by score from document correlation matrix), assuming the score
is greater than minimal required score. Selected few bests related posts
are retrieven from the queue.

Liquid template for each post is rendered and `<related-posts />` is
replaced with the outcomes of algorithm.

## Configuration

In your `_config.yml` file (under `related:`) you can configure:

- `max_count: 5` - maximum number of related posts,
- `min_score: 0.1` - minimal required score to treat post as related,
- `accuracy: 0.75` - percentage of keywords used as basis for document
    correlation matrix (if 1.0 then no LSI is computed, otherwise LSI is
    computed and dimensions are reduced to `accuracy * |keywords|`)

### Weights

You can configure weights of words providing dictionary with them to
`weights`. In example weight of `2` means for term frequency algorithm 
that the word occured twice as much in the document as in reality.

## Benchmark

For casual blogs, performance should not be an issue.

I did not benchmark the plugin, however for the dataset given in the
example (containing ~900 documents, ~7000 keywords) rendering time
(including Jekyll hoodoo stuff) is more less 70 seconds (on Xeon, using
750MB RAM). Computation related to this plugin is about 20 seconds
long. It should be noticed that I'm using OpenBLAS and standard LAPACK
distributed with Ubuntu (performance is similar on OS X using builtin
Acccelerate framework).

Unfortunately the plugin is not compatible with Jekyll 3.0 new
incremental builds, even though it requires at least Jekyll 3.0 (for the
plugin hooks).
